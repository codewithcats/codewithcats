# Front-end Architect ðŸŽ¨
I love designing and building interactivities! I have been working on web front end for 13 years with experiences on various client projects as well as building company products. While I mainly lead the teams on the front-end effort, I am also able to build the whole system including microservices, infrastructure, and DevOps. On people side, I am an energetic team leader who have mentored a lot of software developers and helped them grow in their careers.
